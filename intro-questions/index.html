            <li>Annie (Heyue) Liu, Master of Landscape Architecture, third-year graduate student</li>
            <li>Background: For my undergraduate study, I learned civil engineering. I switched to Landscape Architecture for my master 
                study since I still would like to learn design. I found my interest in digital visualization then. There is also a need in the landscape field that we need to be more open to the increasingly popular social media. This is my last semester in my graduate study life, and I would like to try something new. </li>
            <li>I have no experience with HTML/CSS/JS </li>
            <li>Understand how html works and use it fluently for my design</li>
            <li>More fluent story telling on the screen</li>

                <p>Maya Lin's website always has surprises. It allow people to click on the rotating globe and 
                    select the missing plant.</p> </li>
            <li>https://www.pinterest.com/
